# üõí Rossmann Sales Prediction ‚Äî Forecasting Daily Store Revenue

This project focuses on predicting sales for **Rossmann**, one of the largest drugstore chains in Europe. With over 4,000 stores across multiple countries, accurate sales forecasting is crucial for **inventory planning, promotions, and resource allocation**.  
Through data exploration, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling, this project aims to build a robust sales prediction model using historical store data.

---

## üß™ Objectives

- Analyze historical **sales and customer trends** across stores.
- Engineer meaningful **time-based and promotional features**.
- Handle outliers to improve model performance.
- Build and compare **machine learning models** for accurate forecasting.
- Identify **key drivers of sales** using feature importance.

---

## üìå Key Methods & Approach

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
  - Treated missing values and corrected data types.
  - Removed extreme outliers using the **IQR method**.

- **Feature Engineering**
  - Created **Recency** feature (days since last record).
  - Extracted **Day of Week**, **Promo**, and **Holiday indicators**.
  - Encoded categorical features.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - Sales & customer distribution analysis.
  - Promotion and holiday impact assessments.
  - Correlation and feature significance study.

- **Machine Learning Models**
  - **Decision Tree Regressor**
  - **Random Forest Regressor**
  - **AdaBoost Regressor**
  - **Stacking Regressor**

## üîç Key Insights & Outcomes

- **Sales Distribution**
  - Daily sales mostly range from **‚Çπ2,000 to ‚Çπ10,000**.
  - High-value outliers (>‚Çπ15,000) can skew model predictions.

- **Customer Behavior**
  - Most stores serve **<1,000 customers per day**.
  - Sudden spikes (>1,500) act as noise and were treated as outliers.

- **Promotion Impact**
  - **Promo = 1** days show a clear **increase in median sales**.
  - Promotional campaigns are strong revenue boosters.

- **Day of the Week Trends**
  - Sales **drop significantly on Sundays** due to partial/complete store closures.
  - **Weekdays show more stable and higher sales**.

- **Holiday Effects**
  - **State Holidays result in zero or near-zero sales**, indicating closed stores.
  - These dates are essential for forecasting accuracy.

- **Feature Importance**
  - **Customers** is the top predictor of sales.
  - **Promo** and **DayOfWeek** also strongly influence revenue.
  - **Recency** has a minor negative correlation.

- **Model Performance**
  - **Random Forest** and **Stacking Regressor** performed best.
  - Achieved **~85%‚Äì86% R¬≤ accuracy** on test data.
